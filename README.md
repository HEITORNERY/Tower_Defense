# Readme
This repository contains everything that was used to make the game: Protect Your Tower. This project was my first project with 3D game development, but in it I explored several new programming techniques, such as procedural generation of everything in the game, be it enemies, maps, or scenarios, everything is generated randomly, bringing an infinite number of possibilities to the player. In addition, I developed the ability to work with resources within Godot, which are files that contain all the information necessary for a script and that automatically save every change made.
All remaining assets are in the public domain and are not my own.

# Additional Game Information
The game is endless.
You must position your weapons to defend your tower.
Be careful, there is a limit to the number of towers, so position them strategically.
Each wave has a different time and the enemies can be stronger or weaker, but there can be many, so be careful and think carefully about your strategy.
